Connect Four with Robot Player (CMPS 241 Project)

This repository contains the code and documentation for our Connect Four project, developed as part of the CMPS 241 course. The project implements the classic Connect Four game in C, and later extends it with a robot player capable of making automated moves.

Features
Standard Connect Four gameplay (6 rows Ã— 7 columns grid).
Two-player mode (human vs. human).
Planned extension: Human vs. Robot mode, with the robot making intelligent or randomized moves.

Project Goals
Practice structured programming in C.
Gain experience with arrays, loops, and functions.
Learn about algorithms for decision-making (robot player).
Collaborate using Git and GitHub.

How to Compile and Run

Using gcc:
cd src
gcc -o connect4 main.c board.c logic.c robot.c
./connect4
